- 👋 Hi, I’m @Asantae
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development and UI/UX design. Eventually, I'd like to branch out and start taking part in Dev Ops while learning linux
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to climate change and management of climate related data. My biggest goal is to expand how much I can do/understand.
